# ProcedurlCity
## Description
This generator was made for a project during the 2nd year of my studies. The inspiration for the city is Morthal from Skyrim. There are 3 generators that make this city. The first one is the tree generator (https://github.com/yanniboii/TreeGen) this is one of my earlier works and makes the city look way better. The second one is the road generator which generates the roads using bezier curves that are procedurally placed in a ring-like pattern. After generating the rings it generates the roads that go in between them. The last generator is the building generator it is made using shape grammars. Right now the shape grammars can only generate cubes but it can easily be extended. The materials are also all made by me in substance 3d designer. I found the skybox as a free asset online. The volumetric clouds and post-processing are from unity.
